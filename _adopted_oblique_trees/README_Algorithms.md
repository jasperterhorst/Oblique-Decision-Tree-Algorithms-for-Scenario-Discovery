# `_adopted_oblique_trees`

This directory contains adapted and revised implementations of various oblique decision tree algorithms used for 
scenario discovery, with a strong focus on preserving interpretability, aligning with original papers and keeping runtime
tractable.

These implementations are based on or inspired by the open-source projects 
[Ensembles of Oblique Decision Trees](https://github.com/TorshaMajumder/Ensembles_of_Oblique_Decision_Trees) or
[DecisionTreeBaseline](https://github.com/maoqiangqiang/DecisionTreeBaseline), or created by myself. Each algorithm has 
been evaluated and revised where necessary to ensure consistency with its original academic formulation.

## Reproducibility

Most models have been updated with `random_state` parameters and isolated random generators to ensure reproducibility and experimental consistency.
